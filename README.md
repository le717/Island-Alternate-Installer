# LEGO Island Alternate Installer #

An alternate installer for _LEGO:registered: Island_, written using [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) 
to replace the original 16-bit InstallShield installer.

This project uses code from [@bgbennyboy](https://github.com/bgbennyboy)'s [*Grim Fandango Setup*](https://github.com/bgbennyboy/Grim-Fandango-Setup-and-Launcher)
to pull the files off the disc, modified by Triangle717 to support ANSI and Unicode Inno Setup.

# Features #

* Acts as a full replacement for the original installer
* Lets you install the game with a no CD-ROM patch
* Improved compatibility on modern versions of Windows
* Lets you install the Japanese version of the game without using the original Windows 95-locked installer
